# Project 1: Decision trees
(Keep an eye to this document on github. This will continue to be updated!)

## About this homework
In this homework, you will be introduced to some basic machine learning concepts and be asked to implement and investigate decision trees. The homework will be divided into three parts.

### Part A - Warm up to decision trees
In the first part of this assignment, you will be tasked to familiarize yourself with some machine learning concepts. You will also get some hands on experience with Jupyter notebooks and Python and implement a simple decision tree. 

Follow the instructions in, and complete ``assignment_1a.ipynb``.

### Part B - Predicting survival of Titanic passengers with decision trees

In the second part of this assignment, you will apply the decision tree that you have implemented to a dataset we have prepared for you. Given a set of attributes of a [Titanic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLfqqfNU4o) passanger, you have to predict whether or not the given passenger survived! 

Follow the instructions in, and complete ``assignment_1a.ipynb``.

### Part C - Math problems
Coming soon!

## Files you will edit and submit

 - ``assignment_1a.ipynb``: Will be your edited copy of this notebook pertaining to part 1a of the assignment
 - ``dumbClassifiers.py``: This contains a handful of \"warm up\" classifiers to get you used to our classification framework.
 -  ``dt.py``: Will be your simple implementation of a decision tree classifier
 - ``assignment_1b.ipynb``: Will be your edited copy of this notebook pertaining to part 1a of the assignment
 - `titanic-features.py`: This contains some functions to help you apply a decision tree to the Titanic dataset
